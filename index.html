                the ‘book train tickets’ section, choose your city and its
                station where you will depart from and arrive at.
              </p>

              <p class="font-12">
                Step 2: Then select the date of departure and choose from the
                preferred class of train travel. You can choose between Sleeper
                Class, Third Class, First AC, Second AC, Third AC, AC Chair car,

                fare varies according to the class of travel you choose.
              </p>

              <p class="font-12">
                Step 3: You can now see all the updated train details with their
                schedule and availability. You can filter out by pricing,
                departure time, date, travel class, train types, and even
                stations.
              </p>

              <p class="font-12">
                Step 4: Once you choose your desired train, you now reach the
                review page where you can fill up your details, berth
                preference, and also check the booking details and total amount.

                will be redirected to IRCTC for authentication. All you need to
